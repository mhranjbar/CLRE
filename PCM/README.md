## üìù Overview

Measuring the temperature at different locations within a Phase-change material (PCM) during its melting process is a significant challenge due to its irregular shape and nonlinear temperature changes. Traditional methods can be complex, inaccurate, or expensive.

In this study, we developed four end-to-end deep neural networks that take RGB photos of the PCM as input and predict the temperatures at four key locations as output. Our best-performing model, **WIV-DNN**, which is based on the MobileNets architecture, successfully predicts the temperature with an **average error of less than 0.9%** and an inference time of just **0.03 seconds** per image.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üí° Innovative:** This is the first study to predict the internal temperature of a PCM solely from visual images using deep learning, to the best of the authors' knowledge.
- **üí∞ Cost-Effective:** The method uses a standard digital camera, eliminating the need for expensive thermographic cameras.
- **‚ö°Ô∏è Fast & Accurate:** The WIV-DNN model achieves a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.05 and an average error of 0.9%, with a rapid prediction time of 0.03s per image.
- **üõ∞Ô∏è Non-Contact:** After training, the system can monitor temperature profiles without requiring any physical probes inside the material, making it ideal for probe-free applications.
- **üåê Generalizable:** The methodology has significant potential for other scientific and industrial applications, such as analyzing temperature levels in polar regions from satellite imagery or monitoring snow distribution on mountains.
