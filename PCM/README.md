This repository contains the official code and dataset for the paper **"End-To-End Deep Learning Temperature Prediction Algorithms of a Phase Change Materials From Experimental Photos"**, published in the journal *Energy Science & Engineering*.

This research introduces a novel, cost-effective method for predicting the temperature profile of a Phase Change Material (PCM) during its melting process, using only photos from a conventional digital camera.

## üìù Overview

[cite_start]Measuring the temperature at different locations within a Phase-change material (PCM) during its melting process is a significant challenge due to its irregular shape and nonlinear temperature changes[cite: 13]. [cite_start]Traditional methods can be complex, inaccurate, or expensive[cite: 15].

[cite_start]In this study, we developed four end-to-end deep neural networks that take RGB photos of the PCM as input and predict the temperatures at four key locations as output[cite: 18, 171]. [cite_start]Our best-performing model, **WIV-DNN**, which is based on the MobileNets architecture, successfully predicts the temperature with an **average error of less than 0.9%** and an inference time of just **0.03 seconds** per image[cite: 20, 524, 533].

## ‚ú® Key Features

- [cite_start]**üí° Innovative:** This is the first study to predict the internal temperature of a PCM solely from visual images using deep learning, to the best of the authors' knowledge[cite: 70].
- [cite_start]**üí∞ Cost-Effective:** The method uses a standard digital camera, eliminating the need for expensive thermographic cameras[cite: 21, 536, 538].
- [cite_start]**‚ö°Ô∏è Fast & Accurate:** The WIV-DNN model achieves a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.05 and an average error of 0.9%, with a rapid prediction time of 0.03s per image[cite: 524, 533].
- [cite_start]**üõ∞Ô∏è Non-Contact:** After training, the system can monitor temperature profiles without requiring any physical probes inside the material, making it ideal for probe-free applications[cite: 80, 539].
- [cite_start]**üåê Generalizable:** The methodology has significant potential for other scientific and industrial applications, such as analyzing temperature levels in polar regions from satellite imagery or monitoring snow distribution on mountains[cite: 440, 441].

## üì¶ Dataset

[cite_start]The complete dataset includes **825 photos** of the PCM melting process, with corresponding temperature data for each photo[cite: 130]. [cite_start]For each image, the temperatures at four locations, recorded by K-type thermocouples, are provided[cite: 93, 130].

- [cite_start]**Number of Images:** 825 [cite: 130]
- [cite_start]**Image Resolution:** `600x600` pixels (cropped from `1920x1080`) [cite: 124, 125]
- [cite_start]**Output Data:** 4 temperature values per image [cite: 130]
